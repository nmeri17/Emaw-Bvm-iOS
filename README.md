# Description
A memorization app that allows you to save your favorite verses from Awana, your quiet time, your bible study or discipleship class into folders that you label yourself. You can copy & paste a verse or verses into this app for easy reference. After saving a verse(s) and placing it into a folder (that you can label), you can then open any folder and simply scroll through each verse as you would a flash card to learn God’s word and hide it in your heart. You can set up multiple folders for every area of your life. 
Clicking on a verse will bring up the Chapter and Verse where it is found in the bible. Clicking on it again will bring up the words for each verse or verses so you can check to see if you memorized it word perfect or not. The goal is to memorize God’s word so that you can reflect on it or call it up any time the Holy Spirit calls on you to do so.
